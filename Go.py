    print("Good morning!!I will explain you a thesis..people all around the globe need to be respected this means also women need to be respected...especially them. After a two and a half thousand years of human civilization women are not respected as equals in human societies.THIS means we don't respect ourselves either.This is a huge pushback for human civilization. We are young as species but respecting each other is not quantum physics.. One more thing we also need to respect animal rights..so I want to sum up my ideas rocket science is good but respecting each other is not rocket science. Finally I want to say that there might be confusion lately on everything but we need to see a bigger picture..for thousands of years people all around the globe share common problems common ideas common solutions indepedently from limitations in locality...there is progress but we are on our first steps...We need to learn from each other.The idea is that when you see a simple builder or a politician this person is special and holds a background maybe lets say a network of people being connected with. It's a smaller or bigger world we don't seem to appreciate. I repeat rocket science is cool but it means little if you can't share your thoughts and emotions with anyone!! Being a loner means you can go fast but being with friends means you  can go far and fun.")
